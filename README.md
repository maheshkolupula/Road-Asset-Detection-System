# Road-Asset-Detection-System
Road Asset Detection System is an AI-powered solution that detects road infrastructure such as CCTV cameras, traffic sign boards, and toll plazas using YOLO. It uses Depth Pro for distance estimation and ONNX OCR to extract text, enabling automated road monitoring and smart infrastructure management.
Purpose

This project helps government agencies and transportation authorities to automatically monitor road assets, reduce manual inspection effort, and improve infrastructure tracking using AI.
